# Design-Principles

Given an attempt to cover Object Oriented Design Principles by referring to different sources.

 - SOLID
	- Single Responsibility Principle - there should never be more than one reason for a class to change
	- The Open-Closed Principle - software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
	- Liskov Substution Principle - functions that reference base classes must be able to use objects of derived (child) classes without knowing it.
	- Interface Segregration Principle - focused on the idea of each interface representing one discrete and cohesive behavior.
	- Dependency Inversion Principle - that requires all your code's entities to depend only on Interfaces
	
 - DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself, don't write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place. 
 		 Also duplication is not for code, but for functionality, dont use common code for two different feature.
