ISP is focused on the idea of each interface representing one discrete and cohesive behavior.

That is, each logical group of things an object should do would map to a single specific interface. 

A class might want to do several things, but each thing would map to a specific interface representing that behavior.

The idea is each interface is very focused.

Try to avoid "jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none".
